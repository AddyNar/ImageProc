# ImageProc
More experimenting with git repos to get a hang of things
## Functions
This is a list of functions that will be added to the repo. We're mostly reusing the same stuff from the same repo except I'll be going over more of the basics. A little more concrete too now that the impending doom is a little closer.

# Flow
This repo will be using gitflow, which means that the master branch will only have final versions generally speaking.
